# Stereovision
creating a stereovision system
Cuurent Issue:
Trying to get the rectify.py code working.
The code takes the undistorted_camer1 and undistorted_camera2.png images and goes through rectification when the images are realigned by featuring matching. The error that I get is as following: TypeError: Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument '%s
The image input does not go into the stereocalibrator function.
